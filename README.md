# Brummbär   
## A Discord music bot  
  
## Description  
Brummbär is a Python discord music bot made using discord.ext module and Pomice to interact with Lavalink API to deliver high quality audio from Youtube. Following the end of Rythym, I decided to make my own music bot. It have a feature which make getting the right song from youtube search easier by allowing you to look up 5 top results from Youtube search based on keyword you entered. Other than that, it has normal features for a music bot such as making a playlist, stopping, etc  

### Usage
#### `!stop`    				    
stop the bot, and clear the playlist      
#### `!p` + keyword			
play audio of a youtube video based on the keyword if bot is playing will add to playlist  
#### `!q` or `!query`    
search youtube videos based on keyword (bot must already be connected)   
#### `!h` or `!help`     
will show available commands  
#### `!pl` or `playlist`  
will show the current playlist  
#### `!l` or `!loop`     
will enable loop for the current playlist  
#### `!np` or `!nowplaying`  
will show the track thats currently being played, its duration and current position  
#### `!skip`  
will skip over the current track to the next one in the playlist  
#### `!seek` + number  
Will seek the playing track forward based on input by minutes. e.g `!seek 1.5` will fast forward the track in 90 seconds
